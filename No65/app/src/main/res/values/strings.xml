    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_4">Right, here we are. Quick briefing:</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_5">You\'ll never get out of here this way. Those teleports are cycled.</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_6">You have to go somewhere else. Except you can\'t.</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_7">Unless someone will help you. Who can it be? Who can it be?</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_8">It\'s me.</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_9">I am gonna teach you to jump over one cell.</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_10">You just have to press ”® button (a snail, if you were wondering).</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_11">It changes your movement between walking and jumping.</string>
    <string name="lands_small_preponderance_appears_12">That\'s it. I\'m not gonna give you a proper tutorial. Figure it out.</string>

    <string name="lands_sf3_stuck_2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">I... I don\'t know what to say.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf3_stuck_3">It\'s, like, the EASIEST puzzel in the game, and you\'ve botched it.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf3_stuck_4">You did it on purpose, didn\'t you? No one can be -THAT- stupid.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf3_stuck_5" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">My lords...</string>
    <string name="lands_sf3_stuck_6">You know what? I\'m not gonna help you.</string>

    <string name="lands_meet_holding_together_1">Ow. There they is.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_holding_together_2">Holding Together. Nice kid, but got lost and ended up here.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_holding_together_3">They was wandering here for so long that they has lost their mind.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_holding_together_4">Poor dummy probably doesn\'t remember a thing.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_holding_together_5">They\'s harmless. You can ignore them.</string>

    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_1">Oh no! There is a wall in front of a source!</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_2">Now we are trapped here forever!</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_3" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_4">Just kidding. Just kidding.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_5">First of all: source is a black square and socket is an arrowy button.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_7">Second: you can push source through the wall.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_8">Just jump into the source. Not over it, but into it.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf4_tutorial_9">That way source will also jump over the cell right onto socket.</string>

    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_1">Alright, another tutorial.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_2">You have pushed the source through the wall. Excellent job.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_3">Except! That\'s not where the socket is. It\'s on your left.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_4">\'What do I do?\', you think, \'what do I do?\'</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_5">You sit down on the ground and cry a lot.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_1_6">Alternatively, you can go right.</string>

    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_2_1">Now press the rewind button. It\'s the one with hourglass encircled.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_3_1">You see - the source has returned to its original position.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_3_2">This is what rewind button does: all sources return to where theys were at the start.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_3_3">So when you messed up and pushed source in the corner, just press the rewind button.</string>
    <string name="lands_sf5_tutorial_3_4">Now push the source to the left and get out of there.</string>

    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_spr_2_1">We\'ve got to go.</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_spr_2_2">Just ignore them.</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_spr_2_3">Seems they\'s too weak to hurt you.</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_1">I! AM! NOT! WEAK!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_2">AND!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_3">I! wasn\'t asking! YOU!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_4">AN INTRUDER!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_5">I! will meet YOU! in the next room!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_opp_3_6">Our battle! Will! Be GLORIOUS!</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_spr_4_1">I probably shouldn\'t have interfered.</string>
    <string name="lands_oppression_appears_2_spr_4_2">Well, what\'s done is done. No rewind button for that.</string>

    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_1">Here we ar</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_2">Don\'t.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_3">Move.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_4">Oh. They does not attack.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_5">Phew. Do you even know what kind of a danger we could have been in?</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_6">It\'s the Arousing Thunder aka AT. The person who has created battlecraft.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_7">The way you\'re fighting, the way you\'re protecting yourself - it\'s all their work.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_8">Rumors say that no one can defeat them in battle.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_9">Although, Creative Heaven did. That\'s why AT is here.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_10" tools:ignore="Typos">You might wanna fight, but let\'s just pass this time, okay?</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_11">It\'s not the real AT, therefore, we have no interest in them.</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_12">(I wonder, is it a ghost? Ghosts are scary and unpredictable.)</string>
    <string name="lands_meet_arousing_thunder_13">The real AT is in the core. It\'s where we heading to.</string>

    <string name="lands_arousing_thunder_room_notice_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">Wait a minute...</string>
    <string name="lands_arousing_thunder_room_notice_2">Doors are open.</string>
    <string name="lands_arousing_thunder_room_notice_3" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">But... socket is not connected.</string>
    <string name="lands_arousing_thunder_room_notice_4">How are the doors open then?</string>

    <string name="lands_20_doors_1">Aaaand here goes the most innovative containment system.</string>
    <string name="lands_20_doors_2">Who could have thought AT can open the doors remotely.</string>

    <string name="lands_jail_ksm_offices_2_on_teleport_1">While you feel teleport should have brought you back in offices, it didn\'t.</string>
    <string name="lands_jail_ksm_trapport_1">Looks like some cells return you back.</string>
    <string name="lands_jail_ksm_trapport_2">There should be a pattern. Observe carefully.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_1">Bad %1$s, and not welcome to my -course-.</string>
    <string name="lands_time_of_day_morning">morning</string>
    <string name="lands_time_of_day_afternoon">afternoon</string>
    <string name="lands_time_of_day_evening">evening</string>
    <string name="lands_time_of_day_night">night</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_2">Those puzzles were created for you only.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_3">But theys are not the main dish.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_4">Actually, I have no doubts you\'ll get through thems, since you were in Fist.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_5">But why throw away something so special?</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_6">Bad luck.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_1">Oh no!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_2">It\'s one source, but two sockets!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_3">Open you a secret:</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_4">One socket opens the doors to the next room.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_5">The other deletes your save forever.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_6">And further ahead -spoiler- is a tough boss that can\'t be beaten on first attempt.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_7">So - choose carefully.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_1_8">Ahahahahahahahaha!</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_ch1_correct_socket_1">Not congratulations.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_ch1_correct_socket_2">You\'ve chosen the correct socket.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_ch1_wrong_socket_1">Alright, maybe I did lie about deleting your save.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_ch1_wrong_socket_2">I don\'t have that kind of power.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_5_1">Next 1.5 puzzles are pretty easy.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_puzzle_1_5_2">Hope you\'re stupid enough not to solve thems.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_choice_2_1">The map is called \'Another Choice\', but there is no choice for you.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_2_2">Both sockets are set to crash the game.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_2_3">Basically, it\'s game over for you.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_2_4">Oh, and don\'t save the game here, you\'ll get hardlock.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_2_5">Ahahahahahaha!</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_1">What are you doing?</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_2">You\'re not supposed to connect that socket!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_3">You don\'t even know what it does!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_4">Why are you like a little monkey that presses every button it can reach?! Even if it\'s nuclear launch button?!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_5">You know what? At first, this socket did nothing</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_6">- literally nothing, nothing at all, it just was there, pure and innocent -</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_7">but now it\'ll crash the game.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_cor_socket_8">Enjoy.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_1">Alright, here\'s the real choice:</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_2">In the centre of the room there is a little something that will destroy you.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_3">You can release it,</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_4">or you can pass freely.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_5">If you won\'t release it, I will return you to Empty Street.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_6">I know it\'s tempting, so COME ON!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_7">Release it.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_8">I promise, it\'s not another crash.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_choice_final_9">I can\'t wait to see it in action.</string>

    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_0_1">Alright, love dirds.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_0_2">Here is 15 sockets, five on each side of the room.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_0_3">One socket on each side is connected to the doors.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_0_4">You\'ll waste a lot of time</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_1_1">Actually, you\'re lying.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_1_2">It\'s three top middle sockets that are connected to the doors.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_3">why.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_4">Why do you keep ruining my plans?!!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_5">You understand that this Bunny of yours is evil!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_2_6">They wants to destroy the world, and you with it!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_3_1">Uh, lying again.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_3_2">Bunny would never do such thing.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_3_3">Yes, they may kill someone, but they would never hurt me, that\'s for sure!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_4_1">They are killing everyone on their way!</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_5_1">Well, nobody\'s perfect.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_5_2">And they doesn\'t abduct persons. That\'s enough for meow.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_6_1">Alright. Alright.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_rev_6_2">You\'ll regret it. Both of you.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_7_1">Guess they won\'t bother us anymore.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_7_2">Come on, it\'s the last room.</string>
    <string name="lands_rev_sockets_tmm_7_3">Remember what I\'ve said? Three top middle sockets are the ones you need to connect.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_way_back_1">Hey you.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_way_back_2">It\'s me, the guy from the room before. Small Preponderance, if you care.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_way_back_3">I\'m gonna contact you here and there across the Fist.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_way_back_4">Not that I want to. Nothing personal, just business.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_1">Oh. You\'re here already. Didn\'t expect that soon.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_2">Somes get lost there, or get too frustrated.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_3">Especially at the section with L-shaped things, where you have to switch there and back.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_4" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_5">Now it\'s time for what? For what?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_6" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">It\'s puzzels... puzzles, I mean.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_7">Ah, who cares. Same pronunciation - same word.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_8">This puzzel is easy.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_9" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_10">Oh, you want me to solve it for you?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_11">Nuts. For no particular reason.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf1_12">I just don\'t like you.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf3_1">Still me.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf3_2">You\'re moving forward. That\'s reassuring.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf3_3">But what are you gonna do with two doors?</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf5_5_1">Tutorials are over. Now you\'re on your own.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf5_5_2">You might ask \'Then why did you help me before?\'</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf5_5_3">How should I put it?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf5_5_4">I needed to make sure you can beat the game if you want to.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf5_5_5">Don\'t think about it too hard. Your tiny brain will explode.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_1">Alright, finally, a puzzel with multiple sockets.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_2">Show me what you\'ve got in this empty head of</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_3">PSSSHHHSHST</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_4">And who have we got here? AN INTRUDER!</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_5">PSSSHHHSHST</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_6" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">That... wasn\'t me. Not a good sign.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf6_7" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">Probably some kids having fun...</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_1">Reminder: it doesn\'t matter how badly you put the sources</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_5">- just use rewind button.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_6">Though, it\'s not gonna fix all your mistakes.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_7">It won\'t make you smarter.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_8">Won\'t make you stronger.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_9">Won\'t give your life meaning.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf7_10">And don\'t you dare lying to me that you need neither of those things.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_1">For your information:</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_2">All these puzzels are created to bore you and to wear you out.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_3">Don\'t worry: it\'s just a stage, you\'ll get through, you\'ll get through.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_4">Although, you can stop.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_5">You can exit the game and leave a 1 star review which says \'too boring, failed to beat.\'.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf8_6">No one will judge you. It\'s not your fault the game is dull.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_1">You know, I did not expect Oppression to appear.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_2">It should have been Receptive Earth - nice lady. It would have been soooo much simpler!</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_3">We would have fought them, defeated them and went on,</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_4" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">but this guy...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_5">They\'s afraid to fight us, and is making troubles on our way.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_sf9_6">I wonder: what\'s next? Another softlock? Hardlock? Grindwall?</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_1">Philosophical question: why does timeline go this way and not the other?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_2">Don\'t know about your world, but in this one the reason is this:</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_3">In the future there\'s The Creature that can manipulate time-space.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_4">To be created, The Creature needs to make sure timeline went the way it went.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_5">Therefore, if something happened without visible reason, The Creature becomes this reason.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_6">It\'s a huge bootstrap paradox. The cornerstone of many entities in this world.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_7">Not many persons know that.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_8" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_0_9">I can see your brain\'s like \'did not get a single word they said\'.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_worm_1_1">You probably have lots of questions, hows, whys and whats.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_1_2">Alright, ask away.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_1_3" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_1_4" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_1_5">No questions. Okay then.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_2">How\'s the weather in your world?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_3">Rainy, sunny, snowy, windy?</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_4">I just don\'t have any topics to discuss with you.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_5">And you can\'t provide me any.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_6" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_2_7">Nice talk.</string>

    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_1">We\'re getting closer, we\'re getting closer.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_2">Maybe it\'s not the best moment, but I must confess:</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_3">I have no idea how to defeat AT.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_4" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">...</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_5">Oh, yes. I forgot. It\'s you who\'s gonna fight them.</string>
    <string name="lands_fist_worm_3_6">Then I don\'t care.</string>

    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_1">Seems like it\'s the last one.</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_2">Now we should be near the core, where AT\'s body is contained.</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_3">Here\'s the plan:</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_4">you move through those -things-,</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_5">find AT,</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_6">defeat them.</string>
    <string name="lands_at_lair_finale_7">Easy, right?</string>

    <string name="lands_sec3_event_1">Kneel, vassal, before your lord!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_2">Hi-hi-hi, you pretty thing!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_3">How is my favourite vassal doing?</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_4">Ah, I don\'t care. I am doing great.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_5">Creative Heaven is still seeing red.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_6">They wanted to attack you immediately, but I\'ve managed to change their mind.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_7">By the way, have you heard the latest news?</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_8">They is gathering new 8 lords to defeat you.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_9">Now we have math nerd as a lord of numbers!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_10">Numbers! Would you believe that?</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_11">Don\'t worry, I\'ll sabotage thems.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_12">For now, do your thing.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_13">Walk around.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_14">Enjoy the city\'s lights.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_15">Break into others\' houses.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_16">Ruthlessly kill as much as you want.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_17">You know - hero stuff.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_18">And remember - that\'s not you, that\'s life!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec3_event_19">Keeeeeeeeeeeep living!</string>

    <string name="lands_sec2_event_1">M\'person, I appear again!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_2">Kowtow before me.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_3">My little wonder, how have you been?!</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_4">Ah, I still don\'t care.</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_5">Since you don\'t read newspapers, I\'m bringing you</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_6">BREAKING NEWS!</string>

    <string name="lands_sec2_event_10">Another piece of sad news:</string>
    <string name="lands_sec2_event_11">It\'s the last time we see each other as not enemies.</string>

    <string name="lands_after_completion_2">I am After Completion - the Ying, the time, the father of the world.</string>
    <string name="lands_after_completion_3">I am the puppeteer who have brought you here.</string>

    <string name="lands_after_completion_5">All this for the moment when I am taking back what is mine.</string>
    <string name="lands_after_completion_6">Me and Before Completion - we were deprived of our power, locked in those shells theys call body. Betrayed by our own children.</string>

    <string name="lands_the_creature_intro_3">I am everything.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_0_1">And I have died.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_0_2">You have brought me from the dead?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_0_3">What for?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_1_1">Is it to torture me? Or to satisfy yourself?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_1_2">Anyway.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_1_3">If you want to fight so badly, I will not make it easy for you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_1_4">Although, that is probably what you are counting on.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_1_5">Freak.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_1">Can you do something for me?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_2">If you will defeat me, could you clear the game cache?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_3">That way I will forget that I died.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_4">Remembering my own death is painful, to say the least.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_5">It messes with my brain.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_after_death_2_6">I feel like I would not even know if you have killed me more than once.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_0_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And you are just... a cheater.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_0_2">What, you thought I would not notice if you start the game not from the beginning?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_dead_heaven_1">Well, at least you have beaten Creative Heaven.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_dead_heaven_2">It means you have started this run in the City or even maybe in Fist.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_dead_heaven_3">Even though you have come this far, you have still cheated.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_living_heaven_1">You have not even beaten Creative Heaven.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_living_heaven_2">That means you have started this run in the Temple. Maybe even in this room.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_1_living_heaven_3">What, are you training to kill me?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_2_1">Do you know why there is a debug mode?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_2_2">Why you can access it in the game? Why is it not blocked from players like you?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_2_3">It is here so you can feel like you are in control.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_2_4">But you are not. I am.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_cheater_2_5">You cannot kill me while cheating. That is the rule.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And you are just... you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_2">It is all about you, is it not?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_3">There is no Bannerman. There is no 65 - only you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_4">You, behind the screen of the smartphone or whatever device you use.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_5">There never was a fourth wall. All this time it was you who killed, who moved forward knowing that it will destroy this world.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_0_6">Hope you are happy with yourself.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_1">I am curious: what makes you tick? Why have you finished the game?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_2" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">Not from the point of \'Why are you so bad?\'. No...</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_3">Why are you so persistent? Why did you arrive here, in the end of the game?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_4">Was it a promised reward? Was the game that interesting, that exciting?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_5">Or maybe, once you started, could not bear the thought of leaving the game unfinished?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_6">Out of curiosity? Out of boredom?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_7">You did just because you could? You wanted to prove something?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_8" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">Or, maybe, just maybe... you did it just because, period.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_1_9">I will never know the answer. Will you though?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">You may think we are scripted...</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_2">To be scripted means to follow instructions.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_3">You were following the path I have created for you, doing everything I wanted from you, therefore, you are scripted too.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_4">Yes, I cannot control you. But this whole world was designed for you to follow and to lose.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_5" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">This is your... fate. It always ends the same way.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_6">You do not play - I win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_7">You play - I win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_8">You stop playing - I win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_9">You go on - I win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_10">You lose - I win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_11" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And if you think that, eventually, you can win... You are wrong.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_12">You are not able to lose, that is true. You can always restart.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_3_13">But my whole purpose is to ensure that you never win.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_1">There are paths before you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_2">If you stop here and now, I restore the world and no one gets hurt.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_3">You can get a good ending even after what you have done.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_4">If you proceed, then we fight.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_6">And, maybe, you will win. Then all you see is black. Nothing more. Absolutely anticlimactic.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_7">And winning is hard.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_8">I have a lot of health. My attacks are one of the fastest in the game.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_9">If you think you can defeat me, just answer one question:</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_0_4_10">do you feel lucky?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_0_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And you are just... you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_0_2">Again.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_0_4">The last time was not enough?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_0_5">By the way, did you run through the game thinking it would help you?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_0_6">It will not.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_1_1">You know all the tricks now.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_1_2">I am fast, sturdy, and your health is limited by your kill counter.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_1_3">You think you can defeat me?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_1_4">Do you want it so badly?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_2_1">When I will beat you, do not come back.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_2_3">What for? There is nothing wrong with not beating me.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_2_5">Let a little imperfection in your life.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_2_6">But if you still want to fight, I am going to ask you once again:</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_1_2_7">do you feel lucky?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_0_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And you are just... you.</string>

    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_0_3">You have completed the game two times already.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_0_4">You should have something better to do.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_1">There is nothing wrong with admitting that you cannot beat me.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_2">Rest your head.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_3">Give up.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_4">It is okay.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_5">There are obstacles in your life that you are unable to overcome.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_1_6">This is one of thems.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_1">And even if you want to fight - what for?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_2">I am not the villain in this game. You are.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_3">You do not have the reason. You do not have the power.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_4">So just let it go.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_5">And if you do not want to, the question still stands:</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_2_2_6">do you feel lucky?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_0_1" tools:ignore="TypographyEllipsis">And you are just... you.</string>

    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_0_4">Three times more than necessary.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_0_5">It will not help you.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_1_1">I am going to repeat myself:</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_1_2">You defeat me - you get nothing.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_1_3">I am not lying.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_1_4">All you will see is black screen.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_1_5">The ending is not worth your efforts.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_3_2_1">Nothing has changed since the last time we have met.</string>

    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_1_1">Why do you keep returning?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_1_2">Seems like you hate me a lot.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_1_3">Is it because I am killing you in some world?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_1_4">I am not apologising for that. You brought it upon yourself.</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_2_1">Do you even realize how pointless your quest is?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_2_3">What are you trying to achieve?</string>
    <string name="lands_the_creature_4_2_4">Whatever it is, you will not get it here.</string>
